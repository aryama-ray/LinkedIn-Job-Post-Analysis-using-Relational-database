# Work Overview

The work consists of 2 main components, preprocessing of few of the tables of the LinkedIn Dataset and it contains a set of SQL triggers designed to assist in database maintenance and monitoring for a job posting system. The triggers are designed to handle various scenarios, such as archiving jobs with a high number of applications, expiring old job postings, and handling low-interest jobs. Additionally, there are triggers to log and notify HR when salary changes occur in job listings.
